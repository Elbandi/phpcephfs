phpcephfs is a PHP extension for libcephfs.

The extension wraps the C API of libcephfs into a extension, where almost all the native methods are implemented.

The extension should work on both 32 and 64-bit systems, but due to PHP's engine it might now work well with very large objects.

** METHODS / FUNCTIONS **
For a full overview of the available functions, open a terminal and run:

$ php --re cephfs

** DEPENDENCIES **
Need libraries (Ubuntu / Debian):
* libcephfs1
